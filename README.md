# YOLOv8-Vehicle-Detection
Welcome to the YOLOv8 Car Recognition repository! This project utilizes the YOLOv8 model for accurate and efficient detection of cars in images and video streams. Traditional ML algorithms do not have the speed nor accuracy in detecting object, which calls for a strong need of algorithms that are efficient as well as accurate. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its real-time performance and high accuracy. YOLOv8 builds upon this legacy, incorporating improvements and optimizations for enhanced object detection capabilities. This notebook explores the usage of YOLO-v8 in car detectiion, and shows promising results.
